# peer-to-peer

- **Mission**: Connect VP's of Engineering, CTOs and other technical leaders to stay up to date on what's working and what's not.
- **Topics**: People, process and technology that lead to world-class development organizations.
- **Format**: Virtual [leancoffee](https://leancoffee.org) discussion every six weeks.

## November 10th Theme: Development Velocity

The people, process and technologies that impact **development velocity**.

Submit topic proposals as GitHub issues on the [lean coffee velocity project board](https://github.com/profiq/P2P-Tech-Roundtable/projects/1).

## How the peer-to-peer Lean Coffee Works

The format is based on [leancoffee.org](https://leancoffee.org/).

- Prior to the online meeting we will crowdsource potential topics as issues on the [lean coffee velocity project board](https://github.com/profiq/peer-to-peer/projects/1). Anyone may propose a topic. Topic sponsors start the discussion. If you would like to sponsor the topic, assign yourself as an issue owner.
- During the meeting, everyone will refer to the project board and we will all be in a shared slack channel (information to be provided).
- A facilitator will have the group vote on the next most important topic **to discuss**.
- The topic sponsor will start the conversation with a two minute perspective. Topic sponsors can volunteer or we can go by round-robin.
- The topic is then opened up for an eight minute group discussion.
- A timekeeper will let us know when the timebox is up, at which time we will roman vote on whether to extend the conversation for another five minutes or move to a new topic.
