## How the Peer-to-Peer Lean Coffee Format Works

- Everyone will be in a common slack channel and will have access to the [project board](https://github.com/profiq/P2P-Tech-Roundtable/projects/1).
- We will vote on the next most important topic in the _TO DISCUSS_ column.
- A topic owner will start the conversation with a 2 minute perspective. We will select topic owners either by round-robin or by topic volunteers.
- We open the topic up for general discussion for 5 minutes.
- A timekeeper lets us know when 7 minutes have passed.
- We roman vote
- We either continue the discussion for another 7 minutes, or move on to the next topic
